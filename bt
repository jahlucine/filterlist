\subsection{primes}
We consider a prime number $p\ge5$. Prove that $24$ divides $(p^2-1)$ i.e. $24|(p^2-1)$.

\subsection{primes Solution}
In order to prove that $24|(p^2-1)$ we could prove that $8|(p^2-1)$ and $3|(p^2-1)$.

We note first that $p^2-1=(p-1)(p+1)$, and $p$ being a prime number, $(p-1)$ and $(p+1)$ are two consecutive even integers. Therefore both can be divided by $2$ and one of them can be divided by $4$. We have proved that $8|(p^2-1)$.

We also observe that $p-1,p,p+1$ are 3 consecutive integers. One of them is necessarily divisible by $3$ and it can not be $p$ because it is a prime number. This shows that $3|(p^2-1)$ and therefore $24|(p^2-1)$.

\subsection{Binary}
A trader suggests the following binary hedging strategy for a call option:
\begin{itemize}
\item sell a call option at strike $K>S_0$
\item buy the stock at $K$ when $S_t$ is increasing and crosses $K$
\item sell the stock at $K$ when $S_t$ is decreasing and crosses $K$
\end{itemize}
What is wrong with this strategy?
